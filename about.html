        <h6>About Me</h6>
        <p>
            Hello world! My name is Brian Park (he/him/his), and I am a Machine Learning Compiler Engineer at
            <span class='apple-logo'></span>
        </p>
        <p>
            After being an undergraduate student in Berkeley for over a year, I was highly influenced by the huge wave
            of computer science students and Bay Area tech companies. So I fast tracked my CS curriculum in two
            semesters. I enjoy the limitless possibilities with software. Growing up from Charlotte, North Carolina, I
            don't think I would have ever transitioned into tech without studying and experiencing life in the Bay Area.

            Passionate about accelerating machine learning. Doing everything I can
            to bridge the gap between software and hardware, because at the end of the day, software is the only
            limitation of what hardware can do.
