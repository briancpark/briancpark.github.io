                    This is a project developed in C (C99 Programming Language Standard) to calculate and visualize the
                    <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set" target="blank">Mandelbrot Set</a>. The main
                    function behind this project is motivated by the Mandelbrot function, M(Z, C) = Z^2 + C. Where Z is the
                    center, C is a constant, and Z is an iteration variable. We are interested in how many times Z can
                    iterate, and we set a maximum iteration value because some functions can iterate indefinitely. M and C
                    can both be imaginary numbers. The program also deals with how colors are represented when plotting the
                    Mandelbrot function on a canvas. We use the P6 color pallete where each unique color corresponds to a
                    unique iteration value that is modulated to a set number. To accelerate the number of for loops in the
                    code, parallel programming was implemented to optimize the computation across the cores of the CPU.

                    A digit classifier written completely in RISC-V ISA. All matrix operations were written in the ISA.
                    This was a school project for
                    <a href="https://cs61c.org/" target="blank">UC Berkeley's CS 61C: Machine Structures</a>. This project
                    is special as RISC-V was originated in UC Berkeley and to develop this project it's birthplace was an
                    honor. The full specification of the project for this course can be found
                    <a href="https://cs61c.org/projects/proj2/" target="blank">here</a>. The project is a simple, barebone
                    implementation of the MNIST neural networks. Compared to coding machine learning applications in Python
                    with libraries such as TensorFlow, this definitely got my hands dirty with assembly and neural networks.
                    Operations include vector inner product, matrix multiplications, and thresholding. The simple neural
                    network consists of input matrix, a hidden layer, and output neurons. The MNIST dataset can be loaded to
                    train and improve the model, thus enabling to put a user input that is 28*28 pixels.

                    For the final project of
                    <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa19/">UC Berkeley's CS 188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</a>,
                    a neural network implemented in Python to classify digits. The implementation of the neural network is
                    much more advanced compared to the one created with RISC-V in the previous project. In addition to this
                    project, I implemented another neural network in Python using the TensorFlow library, which is publicly
                    linked to this title. Compared to the school project, my personal implementation is much simpler and
                    generalized with the library functions. Overall, it was fun to implement neural networks from low level
                    language with RISC-V and higher level language with Python and TensorFlow.

                    This is a project developed in Python. This was the final project for
                    <a href="https://cs61a.org/" target="blank">UC Berkeley's CS 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>,
                    which is an introductory programming course for Computer Science majors. The full spec written for the
                    project can be found
                    <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp19/proj/scheme/" target="blank">here</a>. The project
                    runs a REPL environment of

                    in the Python shell, complete with all Scheme functions and properties, much similar to
                    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/">MIT/GNU Scheme</a>. It even throws exceptions when it
                    detects errors and displays the corresponding error type. The project exercises all the fundamentals
                    learned from this course such as object oriented programming, list comprehension, linked lists,
                    recursion, tail recursion, and more. An interactive online version can be found
                    <a href = "https://code.cs61a.org/scheme">here</a> made by the staff of this course. Overall, it was fun

                    A series of projects written in Python for
                    <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa19/">UC Berkeley's CS 188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</a>.
                    The project implements AI functions to the retro game of Pacman. First project was an implementation of
                    search algorithms such as depth first search, breadth first search, uniform cost search, and A*
                    algorithms. Also implemented heuristics for these algorithms to optimally find the most efficient and
                    rewarding path for Pacman to take in multiple Pacman maze environments.

                    The second part of the project involved using game trees such as minimax and expectimax to calculate the
                    the most optimal pathing and strategy for Pacman in multiple Pacman maze environments.

                    The third part involves using reinforcement learning with implementations of Markov Decision Processes,
                    Q-learning, and policies.

                    This project is a personal side project written in Java, meant to apply all my knowledge in computer
                    science. It is in development and there are always new modifications or features added when I learn
                    something new. So far, my knowledge in object oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms to
                    make the backend of the ancient Chinese game of Go. Deeply inspired by AlphaGo, I soon want to implement
                    artificial intelligent features once I finish my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine
                    Learning courses. Data structures such as game trees are too inefficient and impractical for a
                    traditional computer to compute. Once I understand how techniques like deep learning work, I hope to
                    implement it to this game. For now, it is a playable game showing statistics of territories and possible
                    moves. I soon plan to also implement player to player functionality and an iOS or Android app. If you
                    have some input or questions, feel free to email me!

                    I started losing weight and getting fit with a personal trainer. Having a personal trainer when
                    exercising definitely helps because he/she motivates you. But after my gym membership ended, I had to
                    exercise by myself. I found that hard to do. So I used Google's Teachable Machine version 2.0 to create
                    my own free personal trainer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I trained models that correctly determine if a posture for an exercise is correct or incorrect.
                    Programmed with voice feedback, the AI trainer counts and confirms that you are exercising correctly.
                    I've included negative voice feedback for correction or slow pace and positive voice feedback for
                    motivation. It is currently a prototype, and purely a demo to test out Google's machine learning model.
                    You can try the prototype yourself using your webcam!
