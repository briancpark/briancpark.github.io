                    Achieved up to 25.2 TFLOPS DGEMM with 4 NVIDIA V100 GPUs linked with NVLink (80.8% of theoretical
                    peak) for NumS using CuPy, cuBLAS, and NCCL in Python. This was a final project for UC Berkeley's CS
                    267, Applications of Parallel Programs, a graduate course on parallel computing. It was also a
                    contribution to a research project under RISELab, NumS. NumS is a numerical computing library that
                    extends NumPy to distributed systems. It supports backends for Ray, MPI, and Dask. I helped
                    implement a backend for NVIDIA GPUs using CuPy and NCCL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Achieved up to 15.7 GFLOPS DGEMM on a single core Intel Xeon Phi 7250 (KNL) processor (35.1 % of
                    theoretical peak) with Intel AVX-512 in C. Scored 93rd percentile out of 200+ graduate students.
                    This was a homework assignment for UC Berkeley's CS 267.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Achieved up to 8.2 GFLOPS DGEMM on multiple core Intel i7-4770 processor (28% of theoretical peak)
                    using OpenMP and Intel AVX, FMA in C. This was a school project for UC Berkeley's CS 61C, Great
                    Ideas in Computer Architecture (Machine Structures) where we built a simple NumPy clone. Benchmarked
                    110X speed up in DGEMM and 2200X in matrix exponentiation against scalar reference implementation.
                    Scored on average top 100 out of 1200+ students out of multiple categories, scored top 10 in matrix
                    elementwise operations category.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scored 99% percentile simulating integer matrix multiply on Chipyard, a RISC-V simulator. This was a
                    lab assignment for UC Berkeley's CS 152, Computer Architecture and Engineering. Optimized over
                    number of cycles as well as trying to optimize cache coherency on multiple cores.
