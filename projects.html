                        This project is a personal side project written in Java, meant to apply all my knowledge in computer
                        science. It is in development and there are always new modifications or features added when I learn
                        something new. So far, my knowledge in object oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms to
                        make the backend of the ancient Chinese game of Go. Deeply inspired by AlphaGo, I soon want to implement
                        artificial intelligent features once I finish my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine
                        Learning courses. Data structures such as game trees are too inefficient and impractical for a
                        traditional computer to compute. Once I understand how techniques like deep learning work, I hope to
                        implement it to this game. For now, it is a playable game showing statistics of territories and possible
                        moves. I soon plan to also implement player to player functionality and an iOS or Android app. If you

                    This is a project developed in C (C99 Programming Language Standard) to calculate and visualize the
                    <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set" target="blank">Mandelbrot Set</a>. The main
                    function behind this project is motivated by the Mandelbrot function, M(Z, C) = Z^2 + C. Where Z is the
                    center, C is a constant, and Z is an iteration variable. We are interested in how many times Z can
                    iterate, and we set a maximum iteration value because some functions can iterate indefinitely. M and C
                    can both be imaginary numbers. The program also deals with how colors are represented when plotting the
                    Mandelbrot function on a canvas. We use the P6 color pallete where each unique color corresponds to a
                    unique iteration value that is modulated to a set number. To accelerate the number of for loops in the
                    code, parallel programming was implemented to optimize the computation across the cores of the CPU.

                <p>
                    With deep interest in artificial intelligence, I was able to explore and experience implementing
                    neural networks in different environments. Using the <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST handwritten digit database</a>,
                    I implemented MNIST neural networks in assembly with RISC-V ISA, in Python with the use of the
                    TensorFlow library, and in Python without the use of TensorFlow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Implementing the MNIST neural network in assembly was for a school project in
                    <a href="https://cs61c.org/" target="blank">UC Berkeley's CS 61C: Machine Structures</a>
                    This project was special as RISC-V was originated in UC Berkeley. The project is a simple, barebone
                    implementation of the MNIST neural networks using operations such as vector inner product,
                    matrix multiplications, and thresholding. The model consists of input matrix, a hidden layer, and
                    output neurons. Because there are write and read matrix operations in the model, it can be trained
                    and improved as well as taking user inputted digit that is 28*28 pixels. This was my first time
                    programming in assembly and implementing a neural network, so it definitely got my hands dirty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Implementation of MNIST neural network with the use of TensorFlow library was a personal exploration,
                    just to see how a lower level language compares to higher level implementation of neural networks.
                    Obviously, the use of TensorFlow's helper functions make the code simple and clean. But knowing
                    what goes under the hood in TensorFlow's library was insightful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Implementing a MNIST neural network in Python without the TensorFlow library was for
                    <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa19/">UC Berkeley's CS 188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</a>.
                    Instead, NumPy was used to handle the matrix operations of this neural network. After implementing
                    the same model differently three times, I understand the why libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch
                    are popular due to their convenience.

                    A series of projects written in Python for
                    <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp20/">UC Berkeley's CS 188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</a>.
                    The project implements artificially intelligent properties to the retro game of Pacman.
                <p>
                    Search algorithms were used to optimally find the best paths for Pacman to win. Search algorithms
                    implemented were depth first search, breadth first search, uniform cost search, and A* search. Also
                    implemented multiple heuristics to optimally find the most efficient and rewarding path for Pacman in
                    multiple mazes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Game trees were implemented such as minimax, alpha-beta pruning with minimax, and expectimax game
                    trees. Also implemented evaluation functions to optimally play a classic game of Pacman with ghosts,
                    factoring each variable, such as if power pallets are all eaten or nearby, or if the ghosts are scared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third part involves using reinforcement learning with implementations of Markov decision processes,
                    Q-learning, and policies.
                </p>
                <p>

                    I started losing weight and getting fit with a personal trainer. Having a personal trainer when
                    exercising definitely helps because he/she motivates you. But after my gym membership ended, I had to
                    exercise by myself. I found that hard to do. So I used Google's Teachable Machine version 2.0 to create
                    my own free personal trainer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I trained models that correctly determine if a posture for an exercise is correct or incorrect.
                    Programmed with voice feedback, the AI trainer counts and confirms that you are exercising correctly.
                    I've included negative voice feedback for correction or slow pace and positive voice feedback for
                    motivation. It is currently a prototype, and purely a demo to test out Google's machine learning model.
                    You can try the prototype yourself using your webcam!

                    Snake game written in JavaScript using the P5 library. I've implemented artificial intelligent
                    features and used neural networks to make the computer learn how to win snake from zero knowledge.
                    The backend of the snake and code was provided by The Coding Train. Artificial intelligence was coded
                    by myself with the help of the P5 Machine Learning Library with JavaScript. Click to play or
                    interactively watch how the AI bot learns how to play snake!
