                                안녕! Hi, my name is Brian Park. I am from Charlotte, North Carolina
                                and currently go to college at University of California, Berkeley.
                                <i><b>Go Bears!</b></i> I am a proud Korean-American. When I'm not
                                coding I like to go traveling, camping, and extensively binge watch YouTube
                                and Netflix. Here is a link to my <a href = "media/Brian_Park_Resume.pdf">resume</a>
                                if you are interested in recruiting me. Scroll down more to know more about me!
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Why computer science AND chemistry? I initially chose to major in chemistry
                                because I was interested in working in the hardware tech industry, such as
                                making batteries, screens, and cameras. But after being a student in Berkeley
                                for over a year, I was influenced by the huge wave of Computer Science students
                                and Bay Area tech companies. I fast tracked my CS degree and took all the
                                requirements to declare Computer Science BA major in just two semesters.
                                My interests career wise is software engineering. Paired up with my Chemistry
                                BS major, I am interested in quantum computing when that becomes mainstream. Let's hope
                                that I can develop distributable software for quantum computers in the very near future!

                        Here are a few projects that I have developed. Some are school projects and some are personal projects.
                        Clicking on the title will redirect you to my GitHub repo page, or you can click on each project individually.
                        Note that some school project repos may be private due to some courses reusing the projects for future semesters.
                        Feel free to reach out through <a href = "mailto:briancpark@berkeley.edu"> email</a> if you are genuinely interested about the project.
