                        <p>
                            안녕! Hi, my name is Brian Park. I am from Charlotte, North Carolina
                            and currently a junior at University of California, Berkeley.
                            <i><b>Go Bears!</b></i> I am a proud Korean-American. When I'm not
                            coding I like to go traveling, camping, and extensively binge watch YouTube
                            and Netflix. Here is a link to my <a href = "">resume</a>
                            if you are interested in recruiting me. Scroll down more to know more about me!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Why computer science AND chemistry? I initially chose to major in chemistry
                            because I was interested in working in the hardware tech industry, such as
                            making batteries, screens, and cameras. But after being a student in Berkeley
                            for over a year, I was influenced by the huge wave of Computer Science students
                            and Bay Area tech companies. I fast tracked my CS degree and took all the
                            requirements to declare Computer Science BA major in just two semesters.
                            I had the intent to switch out of the chemistry major, but realized that I could use my
                            software to solve my difficult chemistry problems and understandings. After taking all the lower
                            division requirements needed for a computer science major in two semesters, my perception of the world changed,
                            and I saw software as the answer to all things. Every time I interact with technology, in the back of my head, I am
                            always thinking how this piece of hardware or software is programmed to interact with me.
                            I plan to expand my computer science field with chemistry by finishing my Chemistry BS degree off with a concentration in computational
                            chemistry and quantum computing.
                            My interests career wise today is software engineering. And I have interest in artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
                            Hopefully, the rise of quantum computer will come near and we can change how we use computer hardware in the future.

                            Here are a few projects that I have developed. Some are school projects and some are personal projects.

                            Note that some school project repos may be private due to some courses reusing the projects for future semesters.
